# This is the main Apache server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ for detailed information about
# the directives and /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian about Debian specific
# hints.

# This is a CHAPERONE-specific configuration designed to keep things lean.  It is based loosely
# on Ubuntu 14.04 /etc/apache2/apache2.conf, and every attempt has been made to assure that
# system-installed modules and configurations will work.

# The chaperone configuration is designed to work within a self-contained application directory
# defined by APPS_DIR.  Note that it may be a user directory, and thus chaperone allows
# Apache to run entirely under any user account, along with a MySQL server that is also
# sequestered in the same way.   This means that you can have containers "point" to apps
# directories on your host server and manage per-container resources consistently in
# those directories during development, until you move the entire apps directory into
# a production container environment or image.

# The accept serialization lock file MUST BE STORED ON A LOCAL DISK.
