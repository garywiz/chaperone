This is a "mini etc" directory which, as much as possible, is where all normal application and service configuration
files are stored.   For example, in the chaperone-lamp configuration, all MySQL and Apache configurations are stored
here, but may make reference to other files on the system (such as modules and plugins).  However, the normal
startup files in /etc/apache2 and /etc/mysql are not used, as they expect a normal fully-booted system.

System start-up is controlled by the init.sh script, which reads additional startup files from ../init.d.

This is not built into chaperone, but rather is a custom configuration defined within chaperone.d.  If you want,
you can completely change the way things work and invent new startup schemes.  But, this is a good place to start.
